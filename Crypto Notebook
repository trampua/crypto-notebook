# Crypto Notebook

This repository is my research space for exploring crypto markets, token sales, staking dynamics, and on-chain behavior.

## Focus Areas
- Token sale analysis (FDV, allocation, ROI projections)
- Airdrop and TGE patterns
- Staking models and compounding simulations
- Network data and user behavior trends

## Philosophy
Crypto is not just about chasing alpha — it's about understanding systems of incentives and information.  
I use this notebook to think publicly and document evolving frameworks.

*Public reasoning → Better decision-making.*
